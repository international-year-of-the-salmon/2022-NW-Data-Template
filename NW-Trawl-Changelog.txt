## [1.0] 2022-7-20, mod: Tim van der Stap, Andrew Dimond (NOAA)

** Please note that the changes, additions and removals listed below have been done to the original file (stored in the original_data folder), prior to releasing version 1.0 **

### Added
- In the Sampling_Event_Info tab, three new rows are created to parse out previously identified duplicate Station_Event_IDs. These new IDs relate to a separate tow at the same station.
- In the Catch_Info tab, new rows are added to specify catches to the correct tow at each station. 

### Changed
- Duplicate `Catch ID` found in the data file. Changed the Catch ID for 'Salps unident.' from NW2201-NW-2-13-CanTrawl-1 to NW2201-NW-2-13-CanTrawl-18.
- In the Sampling_Event_Info tab, the cruise name has been changed to IYS2022, and consequently in Station Event IDs, "NW2201" in the string has been replaced with "IYS2022".
- In the Catch_Info tab, for Station Event IDs and Catch IDs, "NW2201" in the string has been replaced with "IYS2022". 
- In the Specimen_Info tab, for Station Event IDs, Catch IDs and Specimen IDs, "NW2201" in the string has been replaced with "IYS2022".

### Removed
- In the Specimen_Info tab, double dashes in the Specimen ID have been replaced with a single dash (i.e. NW2201-NW-2-10-CanTrawl-12--11 is now IYS2022-NW-2-10-CanTrawl-12-11).
