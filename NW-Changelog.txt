## [1.2] 2023-03-13, mod: Tim van der Stap, Andrew Dimond (NOAA). 

On March 13, 2023 we received a new version from Andrew Dimond. This new version (IYS2022_Museum_Comments_Update.xlsx) has been stored in the original_data folder. The previous version has been renamed to IYS2022_NW_Data_v1.1.xlsx and will be stored in a sub-folder ('archived') herein. 

The changes listed for version [1.2] below were included in IYS2022_Museum_Comments_Update.xlsx. These changes have been included in the IYS2022_NW_Data.xlsx file, which contains the latest information.

### Added
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' a column 'Comments' is added.
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' a column 'Barcode' is added. The Barcode is a unique number assigned to most specimens that are collected for sampling at sea.
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' a column 'Marks_scars' is added.
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' a columns 'institutionCode', 'institutionID' and 'collectionCode' were added to indicate where specimen samples were preserved and under which collection code.
- In the tab 'Catch_Info' added a catch record to indicate they caught Rex Sole instead of Northern Lampfish.
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' columns 'ScaleCard_Position' and 'Scale_Pref_Code' were added to provide information on scale storage for specimens that had scales collected. The Scale_Pref_Code reflects if scales came from preferred (P) or non-preferred (NP) regions of salmon.

### Changed
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' the Alternate IDs have been fixed to reflect original recording of specimen ID. The column no longer contains duplicate values.

- In the tab 'Data Dictionary', the data definitions are updated with new fields.
- In the tab 'Specimen_Info' the count_method for catch was corrected to accurately reflect whether this was the 'total', 'count' or 'subsample'.

## [1.1] 2022-11-9, mod: Tim van der Stap, Andrew Dimond (NOAA)

On November 9th, we received the latest version from Andrew Dimond, addressing some concerns that were highlighted from the previous version. This new version (IYS_NW2201_Dimond_CrestedBigscaleUpdate.xlsx) 
has been stored in the original_data folder. The previous version (IYS2022_NW_Data_6-21-2022) will be stored in a sub-folder ('archived') herein.

The latest version we received (IYS_NW2201_Dimond_CrestedBigscaleUpdate.xlsx) also included the changes made to issues identified for the older version (IYS2022_NW_Data_6-21-2022.xlsx).

The changes listed for version [1.0] were made to the IYS2022_NW_Data_6-21-2022.xlsx file. 
The changes listed for version [1.1] have been made to the IYS_NW2201_Dimond_CrestedBigscaleUpdate.xlsx file and are found below. 
These changes are included in the IYS2022_NW_Data.xlsx file, which contains the latest information.

### Added

### Changed
- In tab 'Sampling_Event_Info' the Cruise_Name has been changed to always reflect 'IYS2022'.
- In the Catch and Specimen tab: Poromitra crassiceps changed to Poromitra curilensis (as per Jim Murphy). 

### Removed

## [1.0] 2022-7-20, mod: Tim van der Stap, Andrew Dimond (NOAA)

** Please note that the changes, additions and removals listed below have been done to the original file (stored in the original_data folder), prior to releasing version 1.0 **

### Added
- In the Sampling_Event_Info tab, three new rows are created to parse out previously identified duplicate Station_Event_IDs. These new IDs relate to a separate tow at the same station.
- In the Catch_Info tab, new rows are added to specify catches to the correct tow at each station. 

### Changed
- Duplicate `Catch ID` found in the data file. Changed the Catch ID for 'Salps unident.' from NW2201-NW-2-13-CanTrawl-1 to NW2201-NW-2-13-CanTrawl-18.
- In the Sampling_Event_Info tab, the cruise name has been changed to IYS2022, and consequently in Station Event IDs, "NW2201" in the string has been replaced with "IYS2022".
- In the Catch_Info tab, for Station Event IDs and Catch IDs, "NW2201" in the string has been replaced with "IYS2022". 
- In the Specimen_Info tab, for Station Event IDs, Catch IDs and Specimen IDs, "NW2201" in the string has been replaced with "IYS2022".

### Removed
- In the Specimen_Info tab, double dashes in the Specimen ID have been replaced with a single dash (i.e. NW2201-NW-2-10-CanTrawl-12--11 is now IYS2022-NW-2-10-CanTrawl-12-11).
